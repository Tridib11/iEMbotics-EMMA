**EMMA** is a multifunctional autonomous robot assistant. EMMA automates patient registration and vital sign monitoring, effectively managing crowds. It also serves as a guide for patient families, offering instructions and hospital layout information. Voice-activated enrollment allows patients to provide data efficiently. The vital sign data are collected through sensors and analyzed to determine if values are normal or abnormal. If an anomaly is detected, EMMA quickly generates an alert either by calling or messaging. Additionally, EMMA features a chatbot that interacts with patients, improving communication and accessibility. A Pi camera captures the patient's image, which, along with vital signs, is compiled into a PDF report. This comprehensive report provides healthcare professionals with a timely and detailed overview of the patient's current health status, facilitating more efficient initial assessments. By streamlining the enrollment process, EMMA reduces workload, minimizes human error, and ensures accurate data collection and analysis.

## Key Features

### 1. Non-Contact Service
- **Safety and Hygiene:** EMMA ensures minimal physical interaction, prioritizing patient safety and maintaining hygiene standards.

### 2. Remote Monitoring
- **Distance Tracking:** Healthcare professionals can monitor patient vitals remotely, allowing for continuous care without the need for close physical presence.

### 3. Interactive Companion Chatbot
- **Patient Interaction:** EMMA's chatbot engages with patients, offering not only vital information but also interaction and entertainment to enhance mental well-being.

### 4. Automatic Document Generation & Patient Registration
- **Efficiency in Administration:** EMMA automates patient registration and generates comprehensive PDF reports, significantly reducing administrative workload and minimizing the risk of human error.

### 5. Vitals Monitoring
- **Continuous Health Tracking:** Equipped with sensors, EMMA continuously tracks crucial health indicators like heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and oxygen levels, ensuring timely detection of any anomalies.
